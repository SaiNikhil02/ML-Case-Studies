## Project Structure

- `1.Quora.ipynb`: Initial exploration and visualization of the Quora dataset.
- `2.Quora_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Data preprocessing steps including cleaning and feature engineering.
- `3.Q_Mean_W2V.ipynb`: Analysis and modeling using Mean Word2Vec embeddings.
- `4.ML_models.ipynb`: Implementation of various machine learning models for predicting duplicate questions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebooks, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in the respective notebooks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SaiNikhil02/ML-Case-Studies.git
   cd ML-Case-Studies/quora-pair-plot

###  Notebooks
1. Initial Exploration (1.Quora.ipynb)
Load the Quora dataset.
Perform initial data exploration and visualization.
2. Data Preprocessing (2.Quora_Preprocessing.ipynb)
Clean and preprocess the data.
Feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
3. Mean Word2Vec Embeddings (3.Q_Mean_W2V.ipynb)
Generate Mean Word2Vec embeddings for the questions.
Analyze the embeddings and prepare them for modeling.
4. Machine Learning Models (4.ML_models.ipynb)
Implement various machine learning models.
Train and evaluate the models to predict duplicate questions.
